# AI-Powered-Narrative-Memory-System-
 AI-driven memory engine that stores, recalls, and dynamically prioritizes narrative information, simulating human-like long-term memory.

• Built a hybrid RAG-based memory framework with a decay module and reinforcement for frequently accessed mem-
ories, ensuring context-aware recall while preventing critical memory loss.
• Automated semantic recall evaluation, metric logging, and visualization using MLflow/Prometheus dashboards, and
enhanced interpretability with audit reports and version-controlled experiment metadata.
